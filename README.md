Water Collector 2.0 is a premium bot that automatically detects wells, moves between maps, and collects water in Dofus Unity, so you can focus on other things while Clickberry handles the grind.

Smart Well Detection: Quickly and accurately finds wells using advanced screen scanning.

Smooth Automation: Gently takes control of your mouse and keyboard to harvest water and navigate maps.

Easy Setup: Just set your movement keys (2,4,6,8), place your character on the starting map, and click start.

Secure & Private: Never reads your files or sends data online. Only interacts with the game window.

Built-in Session Timer: Choose a harvesting duration (30m, 1h, 2h, Max).
